## Description
This project focuses on debugging techniques and tools used to identify and fix errors in Python code. It includes various scripts to practice these concepts.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- A text editor or IDE (e.g., Visual Studio Code, PyCharm)
- Debugging tools (e.g., pdb for Python programs)

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/JaysonPasquier/holbertonschool-chatgpt-introduction.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd holbertonschool-chatgpt-introduction/debugging
    ```

## Usage
To run any of the Python scripts in this directory, use the following command:
```bash
python3 <filename.py>
```
To debug a Python script using pdb:
```bash
python3 -m pdb <filename.py>
```
